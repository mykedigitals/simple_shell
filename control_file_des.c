 * Desc: If the "feed" argument is negative, the function
 * calculates the absolute value of "feed3" and sets avariable
 * named "absol_val" to that value. It then prints a minus sign
 * to indicate that the number is negative,and increments the
 * "count" variable to reflect the fact that an additional
 * character was printed, then if non-negative, the function
 * simply sets "absol_val" equal to "feed". To print it initializes
 * "remaining" to "absol_val", and then using a loop to iterate
 * through the powers of 10, starting with 1000000000 and dividing
 * by 10 each time. For each power of 10, the function checks if
 * "absol_val" is divisible by that power of 10 If it is, it prints
 * the corresponding digit of "remaining" divided by that power
 * of 10 (using the ASCII code for the digit), and increments
 * the "count" variable. It then updates "remaining" to be equal
 * to the remainder of "absol_val" divided by that power of 10.
 * Then function prints the last digit of "remaining" also
 * using the ASCII code and increments "count" one final time.
 * It then returns the value of "count",
 * indicating how many characters were printed
 *
 * Return: printed characters
